[under construction]

This website is a visualizer for InstructPix2Pix ([Brooks et al. 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09800)), an image-to-image diffusion model that incorporates text as conditional guidance to the input. The architecture uses a combination of text-to-image Stable Diffusion ([Rombach et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752)) with OpenAI's text transformer GPT-3 ([Brown et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)).

The general capabilities of the model include being able to transform an input image, some input text, and generate a new image that is guided on both inputs. 

[perhaps insert a sample image here?]

We train a few models from scratch that recreates the architecture in the original InstructPix2Pix paper, where the results of the models can be played around with in this website. Uploaded images should be square; if not, they are automatically cropped. On the backend, all images are transformed to 256x256 resolution, so images with 256x256 base resolution will generally work best. To seem some examples of simple images and prompts that seemed to produce decent results, check out the [gallery](/gallery).

## Summary of math

Coming into this project, we wanted to have a solid understanding of the math underlying the model. We reproduce some of the things we learned here. Since we had some background knowledge, we'll only rigorously rederive results that we learned or found very interesting.

We begin with DDPMs [(Ho et al. 2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11239). In these diffusion models, we noise images sampled from distribution $q(x)$ through the *forward process*, defined via

$$
q(x_{1:T}|x_0) = \prod_{t=1}^T q(x_t|x_{t-1})\qquad q(x_t|x_{t-1}) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{1-\beta_t}x_{t-1}, \beta_t I),
$$

where $$\beta_t$$ is some noise scheduler. We'll typically see $$\beta_1 < \beta_2 < \cdots < \beta_T$$ to ensure that the final image is pure noise.

It can be shown that 

$$
q(x_t|x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_t; \sqrt{\overline{\alpha}_t}x_0, (1-\overline{\alpha}_t)I),
$$

which makes sampling the forward process very efficient.

In the *backward process*, the goal is to produce a model $$p_{\theta}$$ that approximates $$q$$, where we define 

$$
p_{\theta}(x_{0:T}) = p(x_T)\prod_{t=1}^T p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_t) \qquad p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_t) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1}; \mu_{\theta}(x_t,t), \Sigma_{\theta}(x_t,t)).
$$

Given perfect $$p_{\theta}$$, we can perfectly recreate the original data distribution from pure noise, which is the magic of diffusion. It turns out that $$q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) = \mathcal{N}(x_{t-1};\tilde{\mu}(x_t,x_0), \tilde{\beta}_tI)$$ is tractable, and it can be shown that 

$$

$$

$$
p_{\theta}(x_{t-1}|x_t) = q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) = \mathcal{N}()
$$

## Website details

[under construction]

This website was built from scratch. The main frontend framework was [React](https://react.dev/), and we had some fun integrating libraries like [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/) and [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for styling quirks. We found markdown parsing to be a challenge, but eventually got it to work with [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown).

[backend??]. We faced some challenges deploying the models. 

Feel free to check out our [repository](https://github.com/azliu0/image-to-image-translation). 

## Conclusion

[under construction]

This was a very fulfulling winter break project for us, since we are both very interested in generative modelling and excited about its potential. We are glad to have gained some experience understanding these models at a deeper level. We also found the creation of this website to be a good exercise of our web development skills.

[how good are the models?...]
